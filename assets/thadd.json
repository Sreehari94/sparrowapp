        "treasureHuntDetails":"Malleshwaram, one of the oldest layouts is a cultural and creative hub. The challenge is a melange of places that would give you a feel of this place. ",
        "treasureHuntHistory": "Malleswaram is a prominent cultural hub in Bangalore as there are many renowned dancers, musicians and gurus here. Malleswaram located in the north-west of Bangalore, derives its name from the famous Kaadu Malleswara temple. Originally a village named Mallapura, Malleswaram was developed as a suburb during the great plague of 1898, which caused many people to move out from the city center. Malleswaram, together with Basavangudi, represents one of the oldest residential localities of Bangalore and was planned by the then Dewan of Mysore Kingdom, Sir Sheshadri Aiyar.<br/>",
        "treasureHuntThings":"<h4><b>Things to do in Malleswaram</b></h4><h5><b>Temples of Malleswaram</b> (to make peace with yourself)</h5>(1).&nbsp;<b>Nandeeshwara Temple</b> - Bangalore boasts of many temples, but none is so shrouded in controversy and mystery as this one is. The ancient Nandeeshwara Temple at Malleswaram 17th cross was discovered in 1997, but it has stood for over 7,000 years on that spot. Being buried over the years hasn't diminished its aura. According to residents living nearby, the temple was completely buried and the land above it was a plain, open ground. This underground temple was enclosed within a stone cut courtyard supported by ancient stone pillars. At the far end of the courtyard, a Nandi is carved out of a black stone with eyes painted in gold. From its mouth a clear stream of water flowed directly on to a Shivalinga made out of the same black stone at a lower level. There were steps that led to a small pool in the centre of the courtyard where the water gets collected. The source of water, the sculptor, even the kingdom which built it remains a mystery.<br/><br/>(2).&nbsp;<b>ISKCON Temple</b> – This temple is very modern in its architecture. From the mouth watering Kichadi Prasadam, cleanliness of the temple, charity to social responsibilities it follows a modern approach to religion. The main hall has four large pictures of Lord Krishna's pastimes like his lifting of Govardhana hill, playing with his friends and so on. The temple also has a Dwaja Sthamba, the largest pillar in India.<br/><br/>(3).&nbsp;<b>Kadu Malleswara Temple</b> - Named after 'Kadu Malleswar' this Shiva temple with a holy and charismatic ambience is located at 15th cross Malleswaram. The street behind this is called Temple Street. As the name suggests there are many more temples here viz. Nandi Theertha, Narasimha temple and Gangamma Temple.<br/><br/>(4).&nbsp;<b>Daksina Mukha Nandi Teertha</b> - The main attraction of Dakshina Mukha Nandi Teertha Kalyani Kshetra temple is that the water falls on the Shiva Linga from the mouth of Nandi(Bull), the vehicle of Lord Shiva. The water then reaches the holy Kalyani (tank) in front of the Lord. Lord Shiva is called as Abhisheka Priya, one who always loves Abhisheka.<br/><br/><h5><b>Shopping at Malleswaram</b> (to hold onto your wallets for)</h5>(1).&nbsp;<b>Malleswaram 8th cross</b> - The busiest street in Malleswaram, the 8th cross market has number of shops and vendors selling vegetables, fruits, handicrafts, utensils and clothes.

Bangalore would have lost the prestigious Indian Institute of Science to Roorkee if it had not been for the timely initiative of Mysore Maharani Vani Vilas Sannidhana back in 1901. On behalf of her young son Krishna Raja Wodeyar Bahadur IV, the queen assigned 371 acres of land free of cost at Bangalore and an annual grant of Rs 18,000 a year towards expenses of establishing a research institute. Eventually Viceroy Lord Minto approved the establishment of the Institute, named Indian Institute of Science by Masson and Clifford, on 27th May 1909.
